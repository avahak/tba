    <h3>Efren Reyes Z-shot (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1czUp9k2Uk">Link</a>)</h3>
    <p>The Efren Reyes Z-shot is a legendary pool shot that showcases the Filipino pool player's exceptional cue ball control, creative approach, and ability to execute under pressure. Named after its resemblance to the letter "Z," this shot involves maneuvering the cue ball around an object ball and into the pocket using a series of precise bank shots.
    The Z-shot was first executed by Reyes in the 1995 Sands Regency Open 9-ball tournament. 
    </p>
    <p>Facing a seemingly impossible situation, where he needed to sink the 5-ball while leaving the cue ball behind the 6-ball, Reyes devised a clever strategy. He intentionally banked the 5-ball off the foot rail, aiming for it to hit the 6-ball and nudge it towards the head rail pocket. However, the 5-ball unexpectedly sank into the pocket, leaving Reyes with a challenging predicament.
    With the cue ball now behind the 6-ball and no direct shot to the 6-ball, Reyes had to employ a creative solution. He carefully positioned the cue ball and executed a series of bank shots, zig-zagging the cue ball around the 6-ball and into the pocket. The shot defied expectations, demonstrating Reyes's exceptional cue ball control and ability to think outside the box.
